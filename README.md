### Agent Responsibilities

| Agent | Purpose | Input | Output |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Conductor** | Orchestrates workflow, handles clarifications | Raw text | Coordination signals |
| **Symptom Parser** | Extracts structured clinical data | Free text | ClinicalEvidence object |
| **Risk Stratifier** | Applies red-flag rules, computes urgency | Clinical evidence | RiskAssessment object |
| **Care Planner** | Maps to care pathways with citations | Risk + evidence | CarePlan object |
| **Empathy Coach** | Adapts language for audience | Plan + mode | Patient/clinician response |

## 🚦 Development Workflow

### Feature Development Rules

1. **Test-driven**: Write failing tests before implementation
2. **Gated progression**: ALL tests must pass before next feature
3. **Contract-first**: Use Zod schemas for all API boundaries
4. **Performance conscious**: Maintain p95 < 900ms response times

### Testing Pipeline (Must run in order)

```bash
pnpm lint         # ESLint + Prettier
pnpm typecheck    # TypeScript validation
pnpm test         # Unit tests (Vitest)
pnpm contract     # Contract tests (Pact)
pnpm e2e          # E2E tests (Playwright)
pnpm perf         # Performance tests (k6)
```

**Revolutionary Impact**: First graph-based medical reasoning system for causal pathway analysis.

- **Causal Event Graphs**: Replace vector similarity with temporal medical pathway modeling
- **Trajectory-Based Retrieval**: Find patients with similar medical journeys, not just symptoms
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Advanced pathway similarity using medical event sequences  
- **Subgraph Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring causal patterns across patient populations
